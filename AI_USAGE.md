# AI Assistance Disclosure

## Overview
This project was developed using a **Human-AI Pair Programming** model. While the core architecture and logic were guided by human requirements and specific instructions, AI tools (Antigravity/LLMs) were utilized to accelerate development and handle boilerplate code.

## How AI was Utilized

### 1. Code Generation & Boilerplate
- Generation of initial CRUD operations for Servers and Metrics.
- Creation of DTOs and Mapping configurations.
- Implementation of standard Clean Architecture folder structures.

### 2. Refactoring & Optimization
- Optimization of EF Core queries for better performance.
- Refactoring the Metrics Collection Hub into a more robust SignalR structure.
- Modernizing Angular components to use signals and latest lifecycle patterns.

### 3. Documentation & Schema Design
- Drafting initial API specifications (OpenAPI/Swagger).
- Generating Mermaid diagrams for the ARCHITECTURE.md.
- Summarizing complex infrastructure setups for the DEPLOYMENT.md.

## Quality Assurance & Validation
Every line of code and documentation generated by AI was subject to:
- **Manual Review**: Logic verification and naming convention alignment.
- **Automated Testing**: Verified through xUnit (Backend) and Karma/Jasmine (Frontend).
- **Tooling Verification**: Build and Lint checks were performed after every major AI-assisted edit.

## Statement of Intent
The AI was used as a specialized "junior developer" tool under the direct supervision and instruction of the lead system architect. The final architectural decisions and business logic adaptations are the result of human oversight.
